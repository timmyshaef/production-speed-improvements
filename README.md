# Production Speed Improvements

## Overview
This project analyzed the standard unit building process to identify efficiency improvements. By breaking down production steps and assessing cost and time factors, we optimized the wiring process, significantly reducing labor time and costs.

## Problem Statement
The production team sought to increase output and determine whether adding manpower or optimizing the process would be the most cost-effective solution.

## Approach & Methodology

### Data Collection & Analysis
- Conducted time studies by reviewing each step of the building process, measuring the time and cost associated with individual tasks.

### Process Mapping
- Documented workflows to identify inefficiencies in materials handling and manual labor.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Compared the cost of additional labor versus pre-processed materials to determine the most cost-effective solution.

### Optimization Modeling
- Simulated different scenarios based on wire length standardization to forecast labor savings.

### Stakeholder Collaboration
- Engaged with builders and production teams to validate findings and ensure feasibility of changes.

## Results & Impact
- Standardized wire lengths to reduce measuring, cutting, and stripping time.
- Implemented a pre-cut, pre-stripped wire solution that decreased labor time from 5 minutes per unit to 1.5 minutes per unit.
- Reduced overall labor costs while maintaining material costs at an acceptable margin.
- Demonstrated that process optimization was more cost-effective than increasing manpower.
