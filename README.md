# Production Speed Improvements
This project aimed to optimize the production process for product build by reducing time spent on measuring, cutting, and stripping wire.

## Problem Statement
We aimed to improve unit production speed vs increasing man power.

## Approach
We mapped the workflow, conducted time studies, and performed a cost-benefit analysis.

## Results
By standardizing wire lengths and sourcing pre-cut, pre-stripped wire, labor time per unit was reduced from 5 minutes to 1.5 minutes.

## Tools & Technologies
- Process Mapping
- Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Excel/Spreadsheet Analysis
- Stakeholder Communication
